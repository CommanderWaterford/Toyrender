            Popular Use Cases for AI-Generated Figurines
          </h3>
          <p class="text-purple-200 mb-4">
            Users frequently ask about creating
            <strong>anime-style figurines from selfies</strong>, designing
            <strong>superhero action figure concepts</strong>, or generating

            Technical Specifications and Requirements
          </h3>
          <p class="text-purple-200 mb-4">
            For optimal <strong>figurine generation quality</strong>, upload
            <strong>high-resolution portrait photos</strong> in JPG or PNG
            format (up to 10MB). Our
            <strong>instant figurine generator</strong> processes images in
            under 60 seconds, delivering
            <strong>print-ready figurine designs</strong> at 300 DPI resolution.
            The AI excels at creating <strong>bobblehead-style figures</strong>,
            <strong>action pose figurines</strong>, and
            <strong>miniature portrait sculptures</strong> from standard
            smartphone photos.

            Commercial Licensing and Creative Rights
          </h3>
          <p class="text-purple-200 mb-4">
            Questions about <strong>commercial use of AI figurines</strong> are
            common. With our Pro Pack, you receive full
            <strong>commercial licensing for generated figurines</strong>,
            allowing use in <strong>merchandise design</strong>,
            <strong>brand mascot creation</strong>, and
            <strong>product packaging artwork</strong>. This makes Toyrender
            ideal for <strong>small business figurine needs</strong>,
            <strong>Etsy shop product designs</strong>, and

            Integration with 3D Printing Services
          </h3>
          <p class="text-purple-200 mb-4">
            While we provide
            <strong>high-resolution figurine images</strong> rather than STL
            files, many users successfully use our outputs as
            <strong>3D modeling references</strong> for services like Shapeways,
            Sculpteo, or local <strong>3D printing shops</strong>. The detailed
            <strong>figurine concept art</strong> serves as an excellent
            blueprint for <strong>custom toy manufacturing</strong> or
            <strong>resin figurine casting</strong>.

              <strong>Quick Tip:</strong> For best results with
              <strong>face-to-figurine conversion</strong>, ensure good lighting
              and a clear facial view. Our
              <strong>AI figurine sculptor</strong> works best with front-facing
              portraits for creating
              <strong>collectible toy designs</strong> and
              <strong>custom bobblehead concepts</strong>.

              Start by creating your figurine concept right here in Toyrender.
              Upload a clear, front-facing headshot, choose the outfit or theme
              you want, and download the render once you love how it looks.

            Our AI maintains excellent facial resemblance while adding
            collectible figurine styling. The figurine will clearly be
            recognizable as you, but with the artistic enhancements typical of
            collectible toys - think of it as a stylized version of yourself.

            Use a well-lit, front-facing photo with your face clearly visible.
            Natural lighting works best. Avoid shadows on the face, busy
            backgrounds, or heavy filters. The AI performs best with neutral
            expressions and photos taken at arm's length.
