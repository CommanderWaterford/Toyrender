                and a photo taken straight-on or at a slight angle. Avoid heavy

                Yes, selfies can work well for **AI dating photos** if they meet

                extreme angles, heavy filters, or distorted wide-angle effects

                Fair question! Try our <strong>free risk-free test</strong> - you get 2 sample photos (watermarked) with zero commitment.
                No credit card required. If the quality isn't what you expected, you haven't lost anything.

                Will people be able to tell these are AI-generated photos?
              </h4>
              <p class="text-purple-200 text-sm">
                Our AI creates highly realistic, professional-looking photos that are virtually indistinguishable from professional photography.
                The goal is enhancement, not creating a fake identity. <strong>Thousands of Reddit users report increased matches</strong> without anyone detecting AI generation.
                However, we recommend being honest if directly asked - authenticity builds better connections.

              </h4>
              <p class="text-purple-200 text-sm">
                While we can't guarantee match results (too many factors involved), we offer a <strong>100% money-back guarantee</strong> if you're not satisfied with the photo quality.
                <strong>97% of users report getting more matches within 24 hours</strong>, but if you don't see improvement and aren't happy with the photos themselves, we'll refund your $4.99.
